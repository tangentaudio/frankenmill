* CNC Main Board - Located with the control electronics, connects to FPGA board, provides E-Stop, signal conditioning, and interconnects.
* CNC Machine Breakout - Located on the CNC mill, handles differential signal conditioning and provides screw terminals for I/O
* Geckodrive Breakout - Located one per Geckodrive stepper driver, converts screw terminals to an IDC ribbon cable.  Provides current set resistor function.
* Isolated Spindle Drive - Deprecated, was used in the pre-VFD machine to provide isolation to the DC motor driver.  Flawed electronics design, do not use - provided for historical purposes only.
