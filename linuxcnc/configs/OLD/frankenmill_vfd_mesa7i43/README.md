# FrankenMill LinuxCNC Configuration (with Commander SK VFD)

* Based on the LinuxCNC 2.6 "hm2_stepper" config `7i43-big` (for the 400k gate version of the FPGA).

* See the HostMot2 section of the Integrators manual for more information.

* Requires the `cmdrsk_vfd` component to communicate with the VFD over RS485, see https://github.com/tangentaudio/cmdrsk_vfd
